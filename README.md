# 260-Startup
Startup project for BYU CS 260

Design
Clothes - we can't go a day without them! With the amount of time and money that we spend on clothing, it can be helpful to know what trends are fashionable in order to make better-informed clothing purchases. This voting application will allow users easily vote for their top 5 choices of clothing brands out of some of the most popular clothing brands. The application will, in real time, rank and display the most popular brands according to vote data. It will also allow viewers to log in and and see the voting result of other users.
